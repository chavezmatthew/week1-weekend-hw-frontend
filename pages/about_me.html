He was seen as an old conjurer, and a meddlesome elderly man by some. 
In the heat of battle, however, he showed how incredibly powerful he really was.

After his demise, he was resurrected as Gandalf the White, turning his hair and clothing from grey to white. 
His body was no longer mortal and could not be harmed by weapons, and his power over the Unseen was increased dramatically.
